As of version 1.0.0pre5, lemuria can load goom and use it for
textures. See Goom notes below.

This is lemuria, an OpenGL visualization plugin for xmms and
visualizer4esd. It is my first OpenGL program ever. To compile this,
type

./configure
make
make install

You need the xmms headers (package xmms-devel on RPM based systems)
to get this compiled.

If esound is available, you'll also get a standalone program "lemuria",
which will read audio from any esd player (use -r option for recording
instead of monitoring).

If the mouse is inside the window, you can use the following
keyboard shortcuts:
F:         Next foreground
T:         Next texture
W:         Next world (=background)
CRTL+F:    Random foreground
CTRL+T:    Random texture
CTRL+W:    Random world
H:         Hold effects
A:         Unhold effects
Tab:       Toogle fullscreen mode
Pause:     Toggle pause
L:         Change Antialiasing mode (none->fastest->best->none...)

XMMS Shortcuts:
Z:         Previous song
X:         Play
C:         Stop
B:         Next

Lemuria fully exploits your CPU power up to a framerate of about
30 fps.

Goom Notes:

Lemuria looks in the directory for xmms visualization plugins for
libgoom.so. If it's available, it will be used for textures.
You MUST have a version later than goom-1.9.x installed.
With older goom versions, lemuria will crash.
(There is no possibility to detect the goom version).

Goom appears on several backgrounds, as sky etc, and it's pretty cool.
Thanks Jeko for changing goom for use with lemuria.
