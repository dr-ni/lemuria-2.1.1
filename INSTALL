1. Requirements

Lemuria needs headers and libraries for OpenGL and libGLU. Furthermore,
for compiling plugins you need at least one of gmerlin or libvisual.

If you installed a library but it wasn't found by the configure script,
the error is in 99% of the cases one of the following:

- A binary package (e.g. rpm) was installed but not the development package
 (e.g. for libfoo-1.2.3-4.i386.rpm you also need libfoo-devel-1.2.3-4.i386.rpm)

- The path where the libraries got installed (usually /usr/local/bin for source
  packages) is missing in the file /etc/ld.so.conf. This is the case e.g. on
  Fedora Core 3. Add the path there, run /sbin/ldconfig as root and everything
  should work.

- After installation of the library, /sbin/ldconfig wasn't called

- The package wasn't found, because the environment variable PKG_CONFIG_PATH is not
  properly set. Typing

  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig

  before calling configure helps in most cases.

If all these tips don't help, attach the file config.log to an email and send it to
gmerlin-general@lists.sourceforge.net.

2. Compilation

Nothing special here. It's the usual procedure:

./configure
make
su
<type root password>
make install

The configure script supports some command line options, type

./configure --help

to see them.
