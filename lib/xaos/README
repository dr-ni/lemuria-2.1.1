After 6 years of pause, we have put together XaoS 3.1. In fact, it was
almost complete already in 1997. In addition, there may be other
cleanups and fixes to be done but we leave them for version 3.2.

During this long delay many users downloaded and installed XaoS 3.0 and
also the prerelease versions. Many Linux distributors packages still use
3.0 because the official release have not come out yet. This is the main
reason we decided to push XaoS 3.1 out as soon as possible.

In addition, many developers contributed to the XaoS project. To allow
them the possibility to develop the code more efficient, we moved to
SourceForge, are using CVS tracking and the source code has been
indented using GNU style. The were also some minor improvements
since 1997, e.g. internationalization or adding new fractal types.

The result of the work of the developer crew is this software you can
install now. Please go on and read file doc/INSTALL to continue and/or
read the other files in directory doc/.

Please visit XaoS web site for additional information (xaos.sf.net).
